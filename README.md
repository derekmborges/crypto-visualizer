# crypto-visualizer

Web app made with React to visualize cryptocurrency transactions across many exchanges.

## Week 3 Progress

You can access the deployed app here: [Crypto Visualizer](https://react-crypto-visualizer.herokuapp.com/)

### Organizational structure of the source code files completed

Under `src/`, you'll find the following code organization:

```
src/
  assets/     -> used to store any media files used in the app
  components/ -> used to store the code for each React component
  models/     -> used to store the data models used within the app
  shared/     -> used to store shared Javascript and CSS files
```

### Skeletons of the appâ€™s components have been created without any functionality

Focusing only on the desktop screen size initially, the canvas and the menu have been created and placed in their appropriate positions. The only functionality that currently exists is the ability to toggle the menu to be open and closed.
